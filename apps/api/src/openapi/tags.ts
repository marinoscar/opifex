// =============================================================================
// OpenAPI tag taxonomy (issue #53)
// =============================================================================
//
// The single declaration of every `@ApiTags(...)` name used in this API, its
// human description, and which sidebar section it belongs to.
//
// The tag NAMES here were already consistent across the ten controllers, so
// unlike the rest of this pass nothing was renamed. What was missing is what
// this file adds: a description for each (an undescribed tag renders as a bare
// heading) and a grouping (an ungrouped tag renders outside every section).
//
// One rule this file exists to enforce: NO undeclared and NO orphaned tags. A
// tag used by a controller but not listed here would render with no description
// and land outside every group; a tag listed here but used by nobody would
// render an empty section. Both are failed assertions in
// `test/openapi/openapi-document.spec.ts` rather than something a reviewer has
// to notice.
//
// Ordering is deliberate: `TAG_GROUPS` is emitted as `x-tagGroups`, and the
// flattened tag order becomes the document's `tags` array, which is what a
// renderer falls back to when it has no group support.
// =============================================================================
